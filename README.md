## Ink Shader tries to visualise Minecraft as if it was printed with ink!
Current features include:

- Color Customisation
- Blur Effect
- Stippling
- Edge Detection
- and more!
  

_This shader was heavily inspired on Acerolas video and uses the paper asset that he uses_

### I mostly tested on Iris 1.21, other versions might not work. If you find any bugs or incompatibilities, you can always report them, it helps me and others out :D

### Installation
1. First you need to install either OptiFine or the Iris mod to be able to load shaderpacks. (Choose Iris if you are unsure)
1. Then you need to launch the game, and get to the Shaderpacks/Shaders menu in Video Settings.
1. Open the shaderpacks folder by clicking the button in the menu.
1. Download the Ink Shader and put it in the shaderpacks folder.
